# Analysis-of-Protein-Sequencing-for-drug-discovery

Computational biology is the application of computer science for understanding and modeling biological structures, discovering new drugs, and exploring the area of medical health and information. A computational biology is a great tool for exploring druggable proteins. Traditional laboratory methods for finding drug target proteins are very costly and time consuming. Moreover, Bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms can change their protein sequence over time and develop a resistance to the drugs used to treat diseases caused by the pathogens. Therefore, drugs that were effective in the past are not capable of controlling those diseases. So inventing new drug target proteins or classifying necessary protein sequences are a must. Machine learning techniques can have a great impact on this. We know that protein is an essential element of the body that controls many things in the body. We will work with the primary structure of the protein sequence, which is built up by the amino acids. We analyzed the sequence and found some specific type or class of protein that is useful for the discovery of drug target proteins class and finding out whether that particular sequence is drugable or non-drugable. The Proteins predicted as druggable are further classified into three classes are Druggable for ‘Heart Disease’, ‘High Blood Pressure’, and ‘Schizophrenia’. Here our target protein family is G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR).
